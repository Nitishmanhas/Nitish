# The objective of the game is to maneuver a snake across the game board and collect the food without crashing into yourself or the walls. The game board is a rectangular grid with walls around the edges. The snake starts in the middle of the game board and is controlled by the arrows keys. The game is implemented using the Python programming language, using the Pygame library. The game board is made up of a 2D array of integers, with a value of 0 for empty spaces, 1 for walls, and 2 for food. The snake is represented as an array of x,y coordinate points. The game is controlled by the arrow keys, which are mapped to the functions move_right(), move_left(), move_up() and move_down(). These functions check for collisions with walls or the snake itself and make the necessary adjustments. The game is set to run until the snake either eats all the food or collides with itself or the walls. The score is calculated by counting the number of pieces of food eaten. Once the game is over, a message appears on the screen displaying the score. Overall, the game was successful in meeting the objectives of being
